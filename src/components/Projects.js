               Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
 with my girls. On weekdays I spent time  in my vegetables yard. During the weekends I attend my girls activities like hockey. I also enjoy stay at home, cooking or make some exercise like running.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
              movies and television shows,  I spend a
              large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
